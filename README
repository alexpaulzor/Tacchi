Multitouch table for SIGMusic@ACM@UIUC





Organization of an 'Orb' (musical instrument ui)...
Multiple concentric looping tracks, or 'Time Rings'.
    Each track can have any of the following (simultaneously):
        Instrument
        Sample
        Live stream
        Effects
        Merges
        Removals
    
    Several operations can be done on a time ring:
        Expand duration (by repeating over newly-created track length) [default 2x]
        Simplify track (locate things that are duplicated and consolodate their time).
        Remove a whole time ring
        Merge a timering
